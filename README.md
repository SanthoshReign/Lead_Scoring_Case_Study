# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study
The case study on lead conversion using logistic regression machine learning algorithm.
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. The company thinks that the conversion rate is very low and wants to improve it. To do so, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads called ‘Hot lead’. To identify these hot leads, we need to build a model to find features contributing more on the lead conversion rate. Here, we need to find whether the lead will take the course or not. Therefore, the machine learning algorithm we have to use is logistic regression because it follows classification technique. We’re using a lead conversion past dataset consists of 9240 data points. The target variable used for building the model is ‘Converted’.
